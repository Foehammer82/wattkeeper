# Wattkeeper — Roadmap

Distributed UPS monitoring and management. UniFi-style controller/adopt model:
cheap Pi Zero 2 W nodes run NUT and auto-configure any USB UPS plugged into them,
a central controller discovers/adopts nodes, aggregates metrics, and bridges
everything to Home Assistant.

> Project name is `wattkeeper`. It appears in module paths, binary names,
> systemd unit names, and the mDNS service type.

```

## Phase 0 — Repo scaffold

- [x] Init repo, Go workspace (`go.work`) covering `agent/` and `controller/`
- [x] Top-level Makefile: `make agent`, `make image`, `make sim-up`, `make test`
- [x] CI stub (GitHub Actions): lint + test on push, cross-compile agent for
      `linux/arm64` (Zero 2 W is 64-bit capable) and `linux/arm` (fallback)
- [x] `.editorconfig`, `gofmt`/`golangci-lint` config

## Phase 1 — Node agent MVP

Goal: plug any USB UPS into a Pi running the agent and it appears as a working
NUT netserver with zero manual config, discoverable on the LAN.

- [x] **Hotplug watcher**: subscribe to udev events (netlink) for USB
      add/remove; debounce (UPSes enumerate noisily)
- [x] **Scanner**: shell out to `nut-scanner -U` on boot and on hotplug events;
      parse output into structs (driver, port, vendorid, productid, serial)
- [x] **Config generation**: render `/etc/nut/ups.conf` from scan results.
      Stable UPS naming: derive from serial number so names survive reboots
      and port changes. Template `nut.conf` (netserver), `upsd.conf`
      (LISTEN 0.0.0.0 3493), `upsd.users` (placeholder creds for Phase 1;
      controller-provisioned in Phase 3)
- [x] **Service management**: restart/reload `nut-server` and
      `nut-driver@` units only when generated config actually changed
      (hash compare)
- [x] **mDNS advertise**: `_wattkeeper._tcp.local` with TXT records:
      `id=<pi-serial>`, `adopted=false`, `ups_count=N`, `version=X`
- [x] **Agent node HTTP surface**: local dashboard on `/`, minimal public
      `GET /status`, and detailed `GET /healthz` on :80
- [x] Systemd unit + udev rule files in `deploy/`
- [x] Unit tests: scanner output parsing, config rendering, name stability

**Exit criteria**: fresh Raspberry Pi OS Lite + agent installed → plug in
BE1050G3 → `upsc <name>@<pi-ip>` works from another machine within ~15s, and
the node shows up in `avahi-browse _wattkeeper._tcp`.

## Phase 2 — Flashable image

Goal: one `.img` file. Flash, boot, done.

- [x] pi-gen custom stage: installs `nut`, agent binary, systemd units,
      udev rules; disables unneeded services; enables SSH with key-only auth
      (key injected at flash time via bootfs, same mechanism as Pi Imager)
- [x] First-boot script: expand filesystem, generate per-device NUT runtime
      dirs, hostname = `wkeeper-node-<last4 of serial>`
- [x] WiFi provisioning: support standard `custom.toml` / Pi Imager style
      config on the boot partition so users set WiFi creds at flash time
      without touching the rootfs
- [x] `make image` target that runs pi-gen in Docker and drops
      `wattkeeper-node-vX.Y.Z.img.xz` in `dist/`
- [x] CI job to build image on tag

**Exit criteria**: flash image with Pi Imager (WiFi + SSH key set in imager),
boot Pi, plug in UPS, node is discoverable and serving NUT with no SSH session
ever opened.

While iterating on Phase 2 work locally, validate with this sequence before pushing:

1. Run `make image VERSION=<dev-or-rc-tag>` and confirm it emits `dist/wattkeeper-node-<version>.img.xz` and the matching `.sha256` file.
2. If a pi-gen run fails mid-build and you are refining the custom stage, use `CONTINUE=1 make image VERSION=<same-tag>` to resume from the preserved `pigen_work` container instead of starting from scratch.
3. Flash the image with Raspberry Pi Imager using WiFi and SSH-key customization, then boot a real Pi Zero 2 W with a USB UPS attached.
4. Verify the Phase 2 exit behavior on hardware: first-boot hostname rewrite, `/var/lib/wattkeeper` creation, mDNS advertisement, and remote NUT access via `upsc`.

## Phase 3 — Controller: discovery + adoption

Goal: web UI that shows pending nodes, adopts them securely, and becomes the
single pane of glass.

- [ ] Go backend: mDNS browser tracks live nodes; SQLite registry of adopted
      nodes (id, name, location label, adopted_at, last_seen, agent version)
      Completed sub-milestones:
      - [x] mDNS browser tracks live `_wattkeeper._tcp` nodes
      - [x] SQLite-backed node registry exists and persists discovered nodes
      - [x] Controller JSON APIs expose `GET /api/nodes` and `GET /api/nodes/{id}`
      - [x] Controller is packaged as a deployable Docker image
      Progress so far: controller now has an mDNS browser, SQLite-backed node
      registry, `GET /api/nodes`, `GET /api/nodes/{id}`, a grouped fleet web
      shell with pending-node adopt actions, and a deployable Docker image.
      Remaining work includes the full adopted-node schema and the rest of the
      controller backend surface.
                  Next steps:
                  - Add the remaining adopted-node registry fields such as labels,
                        location/site metadata, and controller-managed display names
                  - Expose controller APIs for updating node metadata and forgetting nodes
                  - Add end-to-end coverage for discovery refresh, registry reconciliation,
                        and adopted-offline transitions
- [ ] **Adoption handshake**:
      1. Controller has a self-signed CA (generated on first run)
      2. Adopt click → controller calls node agent API `POST /adopt` with its
         CA cert + a freshly generated per-node NUT password + agent API token
      3. Node stores them, rewrites `upsd.users`, pins controller CA, flips
         mDNS TXT to `adopted=true`, rejects future `/adopt` calls
      4. All subsequent controller→node API traffic is TLS with the pinned CA;
         re-adoption requires factory reset (documented file to delete on the
         node, or physical button/GPIO later)
            Completed sub-milestones:
            - [x] Controller generates and persists a local CA on first run
            - [x] Controller issues per-node NUT credentials and API tokens
            - [x] Controller UI/backend can trigger `POST /adopt` for pending nodes
            - [x] Node persists adoption state and rewrites `upsd.users`
            - [x] Node flips mDNS TXT `adopted=true` after adoption
            - [x] Node exposes a dedicated HTTPS controller API listener after adoption
            - [x] Controller performs an immediate pinned HTTPS follow-up check using the returned node certificate fingerprint
            - [x] Controller now persists encrypted node trust material and reuses the pinned HTTPS channel for follow-up node health reads
      Progress so far: controller now generates and persists a local CA,
      creates per-node NUT credentials plus API tokens, and calls the node
      `POST /adopt` endpoint. The node persists adoption state, rewrites
      `upsd.users`, reloads NUT, flips mDNS TXT `adopted=true`, and accepts
      post-adoption bearer tokens for mutating UPS control endpoints. The node
      now serves a dedicated HTTPS controller API listener after adoption and
      returns a certificate fingerprint that the controller verifies on an
      immediate pinned HTTPS follow-up call. The controller now persists
      encrypted node trust material and can reuse that pinned HTTPS channel for
      later node health reads.
      Remaining work includes broadening that trusted controller→node contract
      across the full post-adoption API surface, tightening the re-adoption/
      reset lifecycle, and completing the rest of the secure controller→node
      contract described above.
                  Next steps:
                  - Reuse the persisted pinned HTTPS client for more controller→node APIs,
                        not just health verification and follow-up health reads
                  - Add explicit node reset / re-adoption support and document the on-node
                        file or command path that returns a node to pending state
                  - Add controller-side handling for already-adopted, bad-token, and
                        fingerprint-mismatch scenarios at the API and UI layers
- [ ] NUT polling: controller maintains NUT client connections to every
      adopted node, snapshots all variables on an interval into SQLite
      (retention configurable)
                  Next steps:
                  - Add a controller-side NUT client package for persistent connections to
                        adopted nodes over the provisioned credentials
                  - Poll full UPS variable snapshots on an interval and store them in the
                        SQLite `samples` table with retention management
                  - Mark nodes offline after repeated missed polls and surface comms state
                        into the fleet APIs/UI
- [ ] React UI: pending adoptions, fleet grid (status/load/runtime/battery),
      per-UPS detail with history charts, per-node health (temp, disk,
      agent version), rename UPS/node, trigger instcmds (beeper, battery test)
      Completed sub-milestones:
      - [x] Controller has a branded fleet web shell with grouped node inventory
      - [x] Pending nodes can be adopted directly from the controller UI shell
      - [x] Node local UI already provides branded telemetry and UPS control workflows
      Progress so far: the node local UI now has a branded dark/light dashboard,
      live UPS telemetry, instant command execution, and writable NUT variable
      controls. The controller currently has a branded fleet shell, but it is
      not yet the full React UI described here.
                  Next steps:
                  - Replace the current controller shell with the planned React frontend
                        while preserving the shared Wattkeeper design tokens and theme system
                  - Add per-node detail pages and per-UPS detail/history pages on top of
                        the controller JSON APIs
                  - Expose controller-side UPS commands and rename flows once polling and
                        trusted controller→node APIs are ready
- [ ] Alert rules: on-battery, low-battery, node-offline → webhook + MQTT
      (notification plumbing beyond that stays in HA)
                  Next steps:
                  - Define the alert rule and delivery schema in the controller data model
                  - Emit rule evaluations from polled UPS samples and node online/offline
                        state transitions
                  - Add webhook delivery first, then layer MQTT/notification integrations

**Exit criteria**: two real nodes adopted through the UI, credentials never
hand-configured, pulling live metrics, instcmd round-trips work.

## Phase 4 — Home Assistant bridge

- [ ] MQTT publisher with HA discovery: every UPS becomes a device with
      sensors (charge, load, runtime, voltage, status) + buttons for
      supported instcmds; controller/node health as diagnostic entities
- [ ] Optional: aggregate NUT server mode — controller re-serves all
      downstream UPSes on its own :3493 for anything that speaks native NUT
- [ ] Docs: HA setup guide

**Exit criteria**: fresh HA instance + MQTT integration → all UPSes appear
automatically with correct device grouping, controls work.

## Phase 5 — Hardening & lifecycle

- [ ] Agent OTA updates pushed from controller (signed binaries)
- [ ] Node factory-reset flow (GPIO jumper or boot-partition flag file)
- [x] Node HTTP auth bootstrap: first browser client to reach an uninitialized
      node must create the local admin username/password; after bootstrap, the
      node dashboard and detailed node APIs such as `GET /status/details`
      and `GET /healthz` require authentication via a node-local session flow
- [x] Node HTTP surface hardening: keep unauthenticated `GET /status` limited
      to basic aggregate state suitable for discovery and quick checks; avoid
      stable UPS identifiers and detailed node metrics there, and keep richer
      diagnostics behind the authenticated node UI or controller-trusted APIs
- [ ] Insecure node UI bypass policy: keep `--http-auth=false` as an explicit
      local-development escape hatch only; do not enable it in image defaults,
      packaged service units, or controller-managed production policy
- [ ] Session and form hardening for node-local auth: review CSRF protection,
      cookie security attributes under TLS, session expiration/rotation, and
      the exact contract for non-browser authenticated clients
- [ ] Controller-managed node UI policy: let the controller drive the node's
      local UI enabled/disabled state through the same policy surface that
      backs the node settings page, with a documented local override/reset
- [ ] Controller-managed node UI policy: after adoption, the controller can
      enable or disable each node's local web UI and related local-auth access
- [ ] Battery health trending / replace-by estimates from runtime decay
- [ ] Backup/restore of controller DB
- [ ] Read-only rootfs or overlayfs on nodes to survive SD card abuse
- [ ] Multi-UPS-per-node support verification (USB hub on a 3A+ etc.)

## Phase 6 — Documentation & roadmap closeout

- [ ] Update `README.md` so it reflects the shipped architecture, setup flow,
      operational model, and current capabilities rather than planned work
- [ ] Add or refresh end-user and operator documentation for installation,
      adoption, upgrades, backup/restore, and recovery flows
- [ ] Remove or consolidate `.github/` prompts and skills that were only
      needed to complete roadmap implementation work, keeping only the
      customization assets still useful for ongoing maintenance
- [ ] Refresh `CONTRIBUTING.md` so it remains the contributor guide after
      roadmap-driven development ends, removing references that assume
      `ROADMAP.md` still exists
- [ ] Remove completed or superseded planning details from `ROADMAP.md` once
      the project has fully shipped and the roadmap is no longer the source of
      truth
- [ ] Delete `ROADMAP.md` after all roadmap phases are complete and its final
      documentation has been incorporated into `README.md` and any permanent
      docs

## Stretch — Virtual test rig (`sim/`)

Not required, keep it cheap:

- NUT ships a `dummy-ups` driver that replays a `.dev` file of UPS variables —
  perfect fake UPS. A container running the agent with `dummy-ups` entries
  injected (agent gets a `--simulate <dir>` flag that bypasses nut-scanner and
  treats each `.dev` file as a discovered UPS) simulates a full node without
  hardware.
- `docker-compose.yml`: N simulated nodes + controller on one bridge network.
  mDNS inside Docker needs host networking or an avahi-reflector sidecar —
  acceptable jank for a test rig.
- Scripted scenarios: edit the `.dev` file live to simulate going on-battery,
  draining, node vanishing (stop container) → verify controller alerting.

## Deliberately out of scope (for now)

- Cloud/remote access (Tailscale already solves this for you)
- Non-USB UPS transports (SNMP cards) — controller design shouldn't preclude
  it, but don't build it
- Windows/macOS nodes

## Planned features

High-value features that are likely candidates for future roadmap phases:

- Robust alerting system with first-class integrations for common notification
      targets such as Discord, Slack, Gotify, Notifiarr, Pushbullet, email,
      Telegram, Signal, and similar services
- Alert policies and routing: severity levels, deduplication, quiet hours,
      maintenance windows, repeat intervals, and per-site/per-node/per-event
      delivery targets
- Shutdown orchestration for protected systems based on runtime thresholds,
      battery state, and power-restoration handling
- Fleet configuration profiles so groups of nodes can share alert policy,
      retention, update rings, and node-local UI settings
- Historical analytics for outage frequency, battery/runtime trends, and
      capacity planning based on real-world load behavior
- Optional observability export via metrics endpoint or push integration for
      Prometheus and OpenTelemetry-compatible monitoring pipelines

## Considered features

Useful ideas worth keeping in view, but with lower confidence or less urgency
than the planned list above:

- Multi-user roles and audit logging for controller actions and node changes
- Power-event automation hooks for webhooks, scripts, and Home Assistant
      workflows beyond basic alert delivery
- Config drift detection and richer health diagnostics when live node state
      diverges from controller intent
- Support bundle export with sanitized logs, config summaries, and recent
      event history for troubleshooting
- Higher-availability controller deployment patterns beyond backup/restore
