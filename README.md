# Wattkeeper

Wattkeeper is a distributed UPS monitoring and management system built around a controller/adopt model.

Small Raspberry Pi nodes run NUT near the hardware, automatically detect USB UPS devices, expose them on the network, and advertise themselves for discovery. A central controller discovers those nodes, adopts them, collects metrics, and eventually bridges the fleet into Home Assistant.

## Status

This repository now ships the Phase 1 node agent and the Phase 2 flashable image pipeline. The controller and Home Assistant bridge phases are still ahead.

- [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) defines the architecture, phases, and exit criteria.
- [docs/](docs) contains the user-facing documentation set, including getting started, features, FAQ, and operational reference material.
- [.github/copilot-instructions.md](.github/copilot-instructions.md) captures project-specific coding guidance for Copilot sessions in this repo.
- [.github/prompts/](.github/prompts) contains workspace slash-command prompts for each roadmap phase.
- [.github/skills/](.github/skills) contains project-specific Copilot skills for agent validation and Pi-node debugging workflows.

## Goals

- Zero-configuration USB UPS discovery on Raspberry Pi nodes
- NUT-based network exposure with generated configuration
- Centralized discovery, adoption, monitoring, and control
- Home Assistant integration through a controller-side bridge
- A flashable Pi image for simple deployment

## Repo Layout

> [!NOTE]
> Entries tagged `planned` are still future work and are not implemented in the workspace yet.

## Development Approach

Work is intended to follow the roadmap phase by phase rather than building the full system up front.

- [x] Phase 0: scaffold the monorepo and CI
- [ ] Phase 1: ship the node agent MVP
- [ ] Phase 2: build a flashable image
- [ ] Phase 3: add the controller, adoption flow, and fleet UI
- [ ] Phase 4: add the Home Assistant bridge

When implementing code in this repository:

- Prefer Go standard library solutions unless a dependency is clearly justified
- Target Go 1.26+ and Raspberry Pi OS Lite (Debian bookworm) for the agent
- Keep generated configs and service artifacts deterministic and testable
- Write table-driven tests for anything that parses or renders text

## How To Use This Repo Today

If you are starting work from scratch:

1. Read [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for the intended architecture and constraints.
2. Use the matching slash-command prompt from [.github/prompts/](.github/prompts) when the task lines up with a roadmap phase.
3. Implement only the requested phase unless a small prerequisite is needed to keep the repo buildable.
4. Update [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) in the same change when roadmap checklist items become fully complete.
5. Use the skills in [.github/skills/](.github/skills) for recurring validation or hardware-debug workflows instead of rewriting those procedures in every session.

## Releases Today

This repository now produces both versioned agent release artifacts and a flashable Raspberry Pi OS Lite image for Wattkeeper nodes:

1. Create and push a SemVer-style tag such as `v0.1.0` for a normal release or `v0.1.0-rc1` for a prerelease.
2. GitHub Actions runs `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
3. The workflow runs tests, builds the agent for `linux/arm64` and `linux/armv6`, packages each archive with the install assets from `deploy/`, builds the `wattkeeper-node-<version>.img.xz` image through pi-gen, and publishes all artifacts to the GitHub Release for that tag.

You can build the same release payload locally with:

```sh
make release-agent VERSION=v0.1.0
make image VERSION=v0.1.0
```

Image build prerequisites and the flash workflow are documented in [image/README.md](image/README.md).

The user-facing documentation set lives in [docs/](docs). If you are looking for setup steps, product capabilities, or operational reference material, start there.

Local docs tooling is managed with `uv`. Use `make docs-setup`, `make docs-build`, or `make docs-serve` from the repo root after installing `uv`.

For the current user-facing path, start with:

- [docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md) for building, flashing, and validating a node image
- [docs/features.md](docs/features.md) for what ships today versus what is still planned
- [docs/faq.md](docs/faq.md) for common operator questions
- [docs/reference/image.md](docs/reference/image.md) for image artifact, checksum, compatibility, and first-boot reference details
